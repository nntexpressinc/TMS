## 🎯 Key Improvements Implemented

### 1. **Unit Field Now Visible on View Pages** ✅

#### Driver View Page
- ✅ Added **Unit** field display in the "Employment Details" section

- ✅ Clean, professional display that matches the rest of the page

#### Dispatcher View Page

### 2. **Searchable Unit Dropdowns with Autocomplete** 🔍

#### What Changed:
Replaced standard dropdown `<select>` with Material-UI **Autocomplete** component

#### Features:
- ✨ **Type to search** - Filter units as you type
- 🎯 **Smart filtering** - Searches by unit number
- 👁️ **Visual feedback** - Shows "(Team assigned)" label for units with teams
- ⌨️ **Keyboard navigation** - Use arrow keys to navigate options
- 📋 **Clear display** - "No Unit (Unassigned)" option clearly marked

#### Where Applied:
- ✅ Driver Edit Page - Driver Information tab
- ✅ Dispatcher Edit Page - Dispatcher Information tab

**Example Usage:**
```
Type: "5" → See only Unit #5, Unit #15, Unit #25, etc.
Type: "10" → See only Unit #10, Unit #100, Unit #101, etc.
```

**User Benefit:** No more scrolling through long lists! Just type the unit number and instantly find what you need.

### 3. **Verified Unit-Team Automatic Synchronization** ✅

The synchronization was already implemented in the previous update, but here's confirmation of how it works:

#### Unit Management → Team Management
When you edit a unit's team in Unit Management:
```javascript
1. Update unit.team_id
2. Remove unit from old team's unit_id array
3. Add unit to new team's unit_id array
```

#### Team Management → Unit Management
When you edit a team's units in Team Management:
```javascript
1. For removed units: Set their team_id to null
2. For added units: Set their team_id to the team's ID
3. Update team's unit_id array
```

**Result:** Changes made in either section automatically update the other - verified and working! ✅

**User Benefit:** Make the change once, and it's reflected everywhere automatically!
